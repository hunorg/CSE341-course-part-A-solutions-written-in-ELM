# CSE341-course-part-A-solutions-written-in-ELM - Winter, 2013

One of my favourite courses so far. 
The homeworks were asked to be written in SML, but I encourage everyone who is interested in doing it, 
  expecially those who are new to programming, to write it in ELM instead of SML. 

I don't want anyone to use my solutions as a cheating sheet, I mostly shared it to store them somewhere safe, cause I really liked these problems. 

Here you can find more information: https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse341/13wi/#homeworks

Obviously there had to be some changes made in some of the solutions, for example ELM does not have an exception system like SML.

Cheers!
